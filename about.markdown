## Welcome to Tchen's personal blog. 
In this blog, I will share some tech miscellanies📱 and interesting tools 🛠(including tutorials). In addition, I will also upload some useful posts sharing food 🍱🍲🥘 and life experiences 🎞.

The original purpose of this blog was to share some of the technology I've been learning about.

I am a researcher focusing on AI direction, but I also focus on some development projects that are not related to AI. I hope you can also learn something new through my blog posts. And I also want to share the recommended food or travel spots in my personal life through this platform. 

You can find more details about me in [Tony Chen - About](https://tchen.net/about.html).
